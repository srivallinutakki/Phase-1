This section will guide you to:
●	Deploy a Docker container on Docker swarm for orchestration.

This lab has four subsections, namely:
4.3.1  Setting up a Docker instance
4.3.2  Building a custom Docker image to be deployed
4.3.3  Initializing a Docker swarm cluster and deploying a container to the cluster
4.3.4 Pushing the code to GitHub repositories


Step 4.3.1: Setting up a Docker instance

●	Docker version 18.09.7 is installed in your practice lab. (Refer FSD: Lab Guide - Phase 5)
●	Type the following command to check the docker version installed on lab:

	docker version
 


Step 4.3.2: Building a custom Docker image to be deployed
●	First, clone the Git repository on Docker host using the command below:
	git clone https://github.com/Anuj1990/Docker.git
●	Run with docker build command to build a custom Docker image
cd Docker 
docker build -t phpcode . -f Dockerfile

●	Once the image is built, check if it is built properly or not. You can see a Docker image entry using Docker images command

 


Step 4.3.3: Initializing a Docker swarm cluster and deploying a container to the cluster

●	First, we need to initialize Docker swarm using the set of commands given below:
docker swarm init
docker node ls
 
●	Once the node is configured, deploy the custom Docker image on the Docker swarm cluster following the process shown below
docker service create -p 80:80 --name webserver phpcode
docker service ls
curl localhost
