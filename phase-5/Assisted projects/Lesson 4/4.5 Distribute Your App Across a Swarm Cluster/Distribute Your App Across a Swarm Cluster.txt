This section will guide you to:
●	Deploy a Docker container on Docker swarm and have multiple nodes inside a cluster.

This lab has four subsections, namely:
4.5.1  Setting up a Docker instance
4.5.2  Setting up a Docker swarm with multiple nodes
4.5.3  Deploying a custom Docker image to a Docker swarm cluster
4.5.4 Pushing the code to GitHub repositories

Step 4.5.1: Setting up a Docker instance

●	Docker version 18.09.7 is installed in your practice lab. (Refer FSD: lab Guide - Phase 5)
●	To verify the installation:
1.	Open the command-line interface
2.	Type in the command:

docker --version

 


Step 4.5.2: Setting up Docker swarm with multiple nodes

●	Edit the /etc/hosts file across the two nodes via gedit or vim and make the following changes:
172.31.17.73dockermanager
172.31.86.69dockerworker1
●	After modifying the host file with the details mentioned above, check the connectivity with ping between all the nodes
●	From Docker Manager Host instance:
 
●	From Docker Worker Node instance:
 

●	Initialize the Docker swarm mode by running the following docker command on the dockermanager node

docker swarm init --advertise-addr<manager node IP address>
docker swarm init --advertise-addr172.31.17.73
 

●	Once the swarm cluster is initialized, allow the ports mentioned below in security groups
 
 
●	While initializing the Docker swarm cluster, you will get docker swarm join command which can be executed on node manager to add node to swarm cluster

●	Run the command below to see the node status
docker node ls
 

Step 4.5.3: Deploying a custom Docker image to a Docker swarm cluster

●	Create service in Docker swarm cluster

docker service create --name webapp --publish 8080:8080 --replicas 2 jocatalin/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1
 
●	You can now validate if Docker containers got deployed on both nodes or not using the command below
				docker service pswebapp
 

Please Note: We can validate the application using the curl command to see if the application is up and running.
