
           This section will guide you to:
●	Build a custom Docker image using a custom Dockerfile and deploy it on Docker host.
Prerequisites:
●	Docker must be installed on your system.

This lab has three subsections, namely:
4.1.1 Clone Git repository
4.1.2 Docker Build
4.1.3 Pushing the code to GitHub repositories

Docker is already installed in your lab. (Refer FSD: Lab Guide - Phase 5)
Step 4.1.1: Clone Git repository
●	First, clone the Git repository on a Docker host using the command below:
		git clone https://github.com/Anuj1990/Docker.git
Step 4.1.2: Docker Build
●	Then, proceed with the docker build command to build a custom docker image.
cd Docker
		dockerbuild -t phpcode . -f Dockerfile

●	Once the image is built, check the image using docker run command and then run it to initialize custom container on Docker host.
docker images
docker run -d --name phpcode -p 80:80 phpcode


●	Once the container is up and running, validate the connectivity using the curl command to see if php code is running on port 80 or not.
